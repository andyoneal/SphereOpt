# SphereOpt

**SphereOpt v0.5.0 should be considered a "beta" release. The worst you should is experience is errors or graphical glitches, in which case you can uninstall the mod. Please report any issues you encounter.**

Improves rendering of Dyson Shells by drastically reducing the amount of data sent to the gpu per shell. Impact is larger depending on the number of shells in your Dyson Sphere(s).

In a new game with a large and densely packed sphere containing 5,240 shells, framerate increased from 18fps with [DSPOptimizations](https://dsp.thunderstore.io/package/Selsion/DSPOptimizations/) alone to 40fps with SphereOpt.

[DSPOptimizations](https://dsp.thunderstore.io/package/Selsion/DSPOptimizations/) is not required, but I don't know why you wouldn't use it if you're interested in this mod.
